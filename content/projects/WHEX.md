A platform dedicated to empowering people about the inclusion and appropriate treatment of people with disabilities. Through educational resources, workshops and interactive programmes, we aim to foster a more inclusive and respectful society, where all people, with and without disabilities, are valued and treated with dignity. Our mission is to provide the necessary tools to remove barriers and promote equality, ensuring that all people have the opportunity to participate fully in all aspects of community life. In addition, the platform has an integrated chatbot that is fed by all available content, allowing us to answer all user questions and interact with users in relation to the platform's content.
