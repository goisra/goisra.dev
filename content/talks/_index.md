title: "Talks & Presentations"
description: "I truly enjoy being part of tech communities and sharing knowledge through talks, workshops, and meetups. Speaking gives me the opportunity to break down complex cloud, AI, and software topics into practical and approachable ideas that others can apply in real projects. Through these sessions, my goal is to inspire people to build, experiment, and grow in the cloud while helping strengthen the culture of collaboration and learning within the community."
