Hey, there! 👋

I'm Israel Jesús, Cloud Engineer at Nike, specialized in building scalable, secure, and cloud-native solutions on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I currently work within Retail Technology environments, designing and operating cloud platforms that support large-scale, business-critical systems.

My experience spans cloud architecture, serverless and event-driven systems, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and MLOps practices. I've led the transition of machine learning workloads from research to production, designed cloud platforms for real-time data processing, and applied Clean Architecture principles to build maintainable and resilient systems across diverse industries.

Beyond my professional role, I'm the founder and leader of the first [AWS User Group in Puebla](https://linktr.ee/awspuebla). I'm committed to growing technology communities, sharing knowledge, and creating spaces where people can learn, collaborate, and innovate together. I've participated as a speaker and contributor in international tech communities, reinforcing my belief in technology as a tool for collective impact.

I enjoy tackling complex technical challenges, optimizing cloud infrastructures, and continuously learning to deliver high-quality solutions. My goal is to keep building scalable cloud systems while empowering others through community, mentorship, and knowledge sharing.
